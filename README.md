# Emergency Application Project
This is an application built with Python with the purpose of helping the person who is in an emergency situation.
We intended to build this application as if we were in Police Department and helping people who is in need.

The victim will need to provide their name, age, blood type, and location.
We've implemented the app so that if they don't know their location, they can use the GPS from Google Map to access the location and send their location to us.

We are working on implementing the app so that the victim doesn't have to send their location. Our system will automatically detect their location once they press the "Emergency" button.
